An embedded systems project done under the supervision of Dr.Kavita Vemuri from the Cognitive Sciences lab, IIIT Hyderabad.

There are many devices that are in the market which can measure the vitals of people easily and accurately. However, there are a couple issues with such devices.
	1. Most devices currently on the market do collect SpO2 when manually told to do so. It requires the wearer to sync it's mobile to the device. A better approach to the collection of this data would be to have a trigger system to collect this data on an hourly basis.
	2. The sensors used to measure the blood pressure in the devices used today are accurate, but quite expensive. It's been observed that making use of ultrasonic sensors is a useful alternative, with little loss in accuracy and much more savings in cost.

This project aims to solve these issues and create a wearable device prototype that can measure the essential vitals on a periodic basis such as blood pressure, heart rate, temperature and skin conductivity resistance (SCR).
